This is an attempt at using backpack to design a modular register allocator. It
*requires* GHC 8.2.x and Cabal HEAD. The current version is basically just a
backpack-ified version of John Wiegley's [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linearscan][linearscan package]].

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./nab-linearscan.sh # linearscan-1.0.0 doesn't work on 8.2.x
$ cabal new-build
$ cabal new-run regalloc-example
#+END_SRC

If you don't have GHC 8.2.2 just run ~cabal new-configure -w ghc-8.2.1~ first.
